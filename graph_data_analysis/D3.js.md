# D3.js

Downloading D3
Start by creating a new folder for your project. Within that folder, I recommend creating a sub-folder called d3. Then download the latest version of d3.v3.js into that sub-folder. As of this writing, the current version of D3 is 3.4.2.

```
curl -O https://github.com/mbostock/d3/releases/download/v3.5.5/d3.zip
```

Referencing D3

Create a simple HTML page within your project folder named index.html. Your folder structure should now look something like this:

project-folder/
    d3/
        d3.v3.js
        d3.v3.min.js (optional)
    index.html
Now paste the following into your HTML file, so it references D3 in the head and provides room for your JavaScript code:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>D3 Test</title>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="d3/d3.v3.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <script type="text/javascript">
            // Your beautiful D3 code will go here
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
